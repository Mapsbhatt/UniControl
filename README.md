# ðŸ§  UniControl â€“ Gyro & Pressure-Based Controller for Accessibility

**A low-latency, sensor-fused controller system for diplegic patients that converts head and foot gestures into computer inputs.**

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

UniControl is a hybrid controller integrating:
- **Gyroscope-based head movements** (for direction)
- **Foot pressure sensors** (for discrete actions)

It maps real-time gestures to **keyboard and mouse inputs**, enhancing accessibility and enabling even gaming or interactive control.
